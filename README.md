Everything You Should Know About Diffusion Models

## VAE
- Explain the Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO).

## GAN
- What should the optimal discriminator satisfy?

## Diffusion Models

### Basics
- Write down the forward SDE and the reverse SDE.
- Write down the Fokker-Planck equation.
- Derive the probability flow ODE from the reverse SDE using the Fokker-Planck equation.
- Write down the VP-SDE and VE-SDE, and explain their connections to DDPM and NCSN.
- Prove the equivalence between score matching (SM) and denoising score matching (DSM).
- Explain the maximum likelihood training of diffusion models.
- What is the relationship between SM/DSM and maximum likelihood training?
- Explain Tweedie's formula.
- Use Tweedie's formula to transform epsilon prediction into x_0 prediction.
- Derive the optimal denoiser.
- Explain how DDIM accelerates the sampling procedure.
- Explain how DPM-Solver accelerates the sampling procedure. Why is DDIM a special case of DPM-Solver?

### Sampling
- In diffusion models, more sampling steps do not necessarily mean better results.
- Training and sampling of diffusion models doesn't require the same noise schedule.

## Flow Matching
- Write down the close form formula of velosity.

## One-Step/Few-Step Models
- Explain the idea of consistency models (CM).
